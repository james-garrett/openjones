Further Notes
=====
This is a fork of an open-source Java project that was abandonned a few years ago. As a kid I really enjoyed "Keeping Up with the Jones's" and still haven't seen anything else like it. I noticed there's still _a lot_ of missing features here that I'd like to implement. I've made a planning board in the project tab. 

## Update (18/10/25) ##
At the moment this project's stalled a bit due to how the UI is being generated. The original repo programatically designed the original UI in a single garguantuam function that's quite difficult to parse. Untangling it will require a lot of refactoring and painful cleanup that I haven't gotten around to yet.
